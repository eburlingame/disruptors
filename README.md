# Disruptors


## Setup

### Getting started

You will need:
- `docker` and `docker-compose`

And optionally:
- Python 3 and `pyenv` installed for running the python server locally 
- `yarn` for running the frontend locally

### Running locally

It *should* be as easy as: 
```
docker-compose up
```

This will do an initial build of the client and server containers, then start them together.

If you add `Python` or `npm` dependencies (or change the build configuration), you will need to rebuild the containers. You can do this with: 

`docker-compose up --build`

or 

`docker-compose build` then `docker-compose up`

## Structure

The server code is in `/backend`, with the server entry point being `backend/app/main.py`.

The frontend code is in `/frontend`, which is a standard `create-react-app` boilerplate.

When running in production, the Python server will serve the static js files, along with the `index.html` generated by the React app.
